    <h1>How to Guide</h1>

        <h2>Understanding the Goal</h2>
        <p>The main goal of conducting our own phishing attack was to demonstrate how cybercriminals exploit trust and human error to gain access to sensitive information, such as email inbox passwords. By simulating this process in a controlled and ethical environment, we aimed to highlight the serious consequences of such attacks, such as unauthorized access to linked accounts, identity theft, and data breaches, while empowering individuals to recognize and protect themselves against these threats. 
            <br>
            The first step is to establish a connection with the target by acquiring their email address, enabling communication for subsequent interactions.</p>

    <div class="content-block">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Where did we start?</h2>
        <p> First we conducted research on identifying some key pieces of information a hacker might need to access an individual's sensitive data and came to the conclusion that one of the most accessible pieces of information a hacker can obtain is a person's email address. The most commonly used methods for collecting email addresses include “Smishing scams”, where phishers send fake messages via SMS or on social media asking for your email, and of course “fake signup forms” where attackers create fake websites or online forms which are specifically designed to collect email addresses. This led us to two questions:
          <br>
          <br><b>“How do hackers acquire people’s email addresses?”</b> and <b>“How could we do the same without crossing any lines?”</b> 
        </p>
      </div>

    <div class="content-block">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>Obtaining people's email addresses</h2>
        <p>Knowing that it's quite common for students to support one another by participating in surveys  for various projects, especially when they're engaging and relatable, we decided to do just that, target our fellow students (unknowingly of course). We wanted to see how willing they are to provide us with their data without questioning our intention. 
          <br>
          <br>That's when we decided on creating a survey around the idea of implementing a “Pizza Friday” on campus. We knew people love pizza and we knew they would participate, but <b>would they give us their email data just for the sake of participating ? </b>
          <br>
          <br><b>Actually they did ! </b>
          <br>
          <br>We made it mandatory for students that wanted to participate to first sign up with their email address to even access the survey. 
          
          And that's how <b>we collected in the span of 4 days about 50 email addresses</b> with our fake “Pizza Friday".

    <div class="content-block">
      <div class="text">
        <h2>What did we do with the Emails?</h2>
        <p> Now that we collected the email addresses the Phishing process could have started, but because we didn't want to cross that line we decided on using the data collected to advertise the conference by sending a quite mysterious mail to our participants.

        <h2>What are the technicals behind it?</h2>
        <p> By combining Perplexity AI and YouTube tutorials, we explored the methods attackers use to design and execute phishing campaigns. When faced with challenges, we copied error messages or questions directly from the terminal into Perplexity, asking for clear solutions. This iterative process, complemented by step-by-step video guides, allowed us to understand the mechanics of phishing attacks in a controlled and ethical environment, helping us to create our own attack.
        
          <br>  
          <h3>2. Sending Phishing Emails</h3>
            <p>Using the collected email addresses, we sent phishing emails prompting users to log in. These emails redirected recipients to a credential-harvesting website.</p>
          
          <h3>3. Setting Up the Credential-Harvesting Website</h3>
          <p>To set up our website we used tools like BlackEye or Zphisher.</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

          <li>Basic setup involved:</li>

                <li>Using the collected email addresses, we sent phishing emails prompting users to log in. These emails redirected recipients to a credential-harvesting website.</li>
              <li>Opening the terminal and installing necessary tools via GitHub (e.g., sudo git).</li>
              <li>the phishing tool and addressing issues like the lack of HTTPS secure tunnels by installing solutions like ngrok or using website forwarding.</li>
              <li>We referenced detailed guides, including YouTube tutorials, and used tools like Perplexity AI to troubleshoot any problems.</li>
